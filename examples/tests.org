#+TITLE: Tests

* TODO Close shift but bad initial vector
  + Could use standard inverse iteration for a few steps (guaranteed to converge independent of initial vec)

* TODO Bad shift but good initial vector
  + Replace shift by Rayleigh quotient and either use standard inverse iteration or "normal" RQI

* TODO Perturb vector by white noise

* TODO Shift \lambda in between two eigenvalues

* TODO Finite difference discretization of 2D Laplacian
