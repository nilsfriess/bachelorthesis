* CHAPTER 1 [0%]
** TODO Photonic crystal fibres example [0%]
*** TODO Read Norton's phd thesis
*** TODO Read Scheichl & Norton paper
*** TODO Read Scheichl & Marletta paper
*** TODO Implement Matlab example that demostrates the band structure of the spectrum
*** TODO Try computing an eigenvalue using classic RQI
*** TODO Try computing an eigenvalue using Complex RQI

* CHAPTER 2 [0%]
** TODO Check the least squares derivation
** TODO Search and add references that mention the "RQ is quadratically accurate"
** TODO Rewrite the "Residual based error control" part (see Börm, maybe Saad?)
*** TODO Describe how RQ can be used to provide stopping criterion for power iterations and mention that the eigenvalues converge faster than the eigenvectors
** TODO Remove example 2.5
** TODO Shorten the History section
** TODO Describe that RQI and other methods do not incooporate the RHS (ie the eigenvector approximation)
** TODO Inside the proof of cubic convergence mentioned that we proofed the quadratic accuracy

* CHAPTER 3 [0%]
** TODO Finish intro for chapter
** TODO Rewrite the motiviation (make more concise)
** TODO Show that it doesnt matter if CRQI is applied to matrix with orth. projection or without
*** TODO Show that (in exact arithmetic) the computed eigenvector and eigenvalue sequences are the same
** TODO Discuss Numerical Examples
*** TODO Collect examples that express something useful
**** TODO Convergence rate
**** TODO Dependence on initial vector compared to classic RQI
**** TODO Dependence on different initial shifts compared to classic RQI
**** TODO How good does the eigenvector approximation need to be (Try eg. vector that is a weighted sum of exact eigenvector and random combination of remaining eigenvectors)
