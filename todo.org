* CHAPTER 2 [66%]
** DONE Check the least squares derivation
** TODO Search References from spectral theorem in [Friedberg - Linear Algebra]
** TODO Search and add references that mention the "RQ is quadratically accurate"
** TODO Rewrite the "Residual based error control" part (see Börm, maybe Saad?)
*** Describe how RQ can be used to provide stopping criterion for power iterations and mention that the eigenvalues converge faster than the eigenvectors
*** Discuss problems with closely spaced eigenvalues
** DONE Remove example 2.5
** DONE In history section, add recent contributions
** DONE Describe that RQI and other methods do not incooporate the RHS (ie the eigenvector approximation)
** DONE Inside the proof of cubic convergence mentioned that we proofed the quadratic accuracy
** DONE Read Ostrowski's other papers and add details to the History section
* CHAPTER 3 [40%]
** DONE Finish intro for chapter
** DONE Rewrite the motiviation (make more concise)
** TODO Show that it doesnt matter if CRQI is applied to matrix with orth. projection or without
*** TODO Show that (in exact arithmetic) the computed eigenvector and eigenvalue sequences are the same
** TODO Discuss Numerical Examples
*** TODO Collect examples that express something useful
**** TODO Convergence rate
**** TODO Dependence on initial vector compared to classic RQI
**** TODO Dependence on different initial shifts compared to classic RQI
**** TODO How good does the eigenvector approximation need to be (Try eg. vector that is a weighted sum of exact eigenvector and random combination of remaining eigenvectors)
** TODO Apply numerical examples to better test matrices (Wilkinson matrix etc)
* GENERAL [50%]
** DONE Rename and sort papers, articles, books by topic
** DONE Revise current state of thesis and send to Rob and Alec 
   DEADLINE: <2020-03-30 Mon 12:00> 
** TODO Write abstracts
*** TODO German version
*** TODO English version
** TODO Add Matlab code to appendix
