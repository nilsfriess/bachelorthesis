\section{Convergence Analysis}\label{sec:convergence}
We mentioned earlier the local cubic convergence of RQI. In this
section we give a proof of this claim and we also show that RQI
converges globally.

As we will see in the next section, the first rigorous proof of the
cubic convergence of RQI was given by Ostrowksi in
1958~\cite{ostrowskiI}.
