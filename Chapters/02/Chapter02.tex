\chapter{Classic Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}\label{chapter:rqi} 
In this chapter we thouroughly introduce the Rayleigh Quotient
Iteration (or RQI, for short) and present important results
regarding its analyis. Among others, we give a proof of the (local) cubic
convergence of RQI. We provide numerical examples for the presented
results and discuss disadvantages and shortcomings that will directly
lead us the main part of the thesis, discussed in the next chapter.
