\chapter{Classic Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}\label{chapter:rqi}
In this chapter we thoroughly introduce the Rayleigh Quotient
Iteration (or RQI, for short) and discuss some important
results. Among others, we give a proof of the (local) cubic
convergence of RQI. We provide numerical examples for the presented
results and discuss disadvantages and shortcomings.

As mentioned above, we assume that we have given an approximation of
an eigenvector of a real symmetric matrix $\mat{A}$ and we want to
compute the exact eigenvector and corresponding eigenvalue.

% The following section gives us a method to obtain an estimate of the
% eigenvalue. RQI, then is an iterative method to subsequently improve
% the approximations of the eigenvector and -value.
