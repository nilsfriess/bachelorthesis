\section{Motivation}
The following example introduces a physical problem that requires the
solution of an eigenvalue problem. There is a plethora of problems
which lead to eigenvalue problems in almost all of the natural
sciences but also in finance and other social sciences (see, for
example, \todo{References for eigenvalue problems}).
\begin{example}[Photonic Crystal Fibres]%
