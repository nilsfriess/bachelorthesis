\section{Motivation}
The following example introduces a physical problem that requires the
solution of an eigenvalue problem. Of course there are numerous
problems in almost all of the natural sciences but also in finance and other
social sciences (see, for example, \todo{References for eigenvalue problems}).
\begin{example}[Photonic Crystal Fibres]%
