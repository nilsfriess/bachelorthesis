\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:intro}%
This thesis presents a modification of the \emph{Rayleigh Quotient
  Iteration} that improves convergence to a target eigenpair under the
assumption that a good approximation of the eigenvector but possibly
not the eigenvalue is available. In this chapter we introduce an
example from physics that has this property. We also collect all the
definitions and results from linear algebra that will be needed later.
Finally, we describe the objectives of this thesis.
