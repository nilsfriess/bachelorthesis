\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:intro}%
This thesis introduces a novel shift-and-invert-type method that is
similar to the \emph{Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (RQI)}. Numerical
examples suggest that this method overcomes some of the drawbacks of
RQI. Before we introduce this new method we collect all the necesarry
definitions and results from numerical linear algebra in the next
section. We will finish off this introductory chapter be reviewing
some of the most basic iterative methods to compute eigenvalues.

In the next chapter we study the classic Rayleigh Quotient Iteration.
Among others, we give a proof for the property that makes it so
popular, namely the local cubic convergence.\todo{Rewrite}

The third chapter is devoted to the novel method that we call
\emph{Complex Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}. We give many different
numerical examples and carefully analyse them.
