\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:intro}%
This thesis introduces a novel shift-and-invert-type method for
computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric matrices that
can be seen as a modification of \emph{Rayleigh Quotient Iteration
  (RQI)}. Numerical examples suggest that our method overcomes some of
the drawbacks of RQI at the expense of slower convergence.

The thesis is structured as follows. In this chapter, we discuss a
model problem from physics before we collect all the necesarry
definitions and results from numerical linear algebra that will be
needed later. We finish this introductory chapter by reviewing some of
the most basic iterative methods for computing eigenvectors.

The second chapter is devoted to the study of the Rayleigh Quotient
and Rayleigh Quotient Iteration. Among others, we give a proof for the
property that makes it so popular, namely the local cubic convergence.

In the third chapter we introduce our novel method that we call
\emph{Complex Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}. After motivating the
method we carefully study different numerical examples to better
understand the behaviour of the method.
