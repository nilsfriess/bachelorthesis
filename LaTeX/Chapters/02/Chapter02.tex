\chapter{Classic Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}\label{chapter:rqi}
In this chapter we introduce the Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (or RQI,
for short) and discuss some important results. Among others, we give a
proof of the most appealing property of RQI, namely the (local) cubic
convergence.

It will turn out that RQI is a suitable choice if we omit the last
assumption. Although a different linear system has to be solved at
each step, RQI often converges within a few steps when stared with a
sufficiently good eigenvector approximation. The number of steps does
not necessarily increase much when the eigenvalues are closely
spaced. However, RQI usually fails to compute the right eigenpair in
this cases and it is generally impossible to predict which eigenpair
the method will converge to. The main goal of the next chapter is to
design a method that overcomes this problem.
