\chapter{Classic Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}\label{chapter:rqi}
In this chapter we thoroughly introduce Rayleigh Quotient Iteration
(or RQI, for short) and discuss some important results. Among others,
we give a proof of the (local) cubic convergence of RQI. We provide
numerical examples for the presented results and discuss some
disadvantages.

As mentioned above, we assume that we have given an approximation of
an eigenvector of a real symmetric matrix $\mat{A}$ and we want to
compute the exact eigenvector and corresponding eigenvalue.
