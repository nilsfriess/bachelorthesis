\chapter{Classic Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}\label{chapter:rqi}
In this chapter we introduce the Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (or RQI,
for short) and discuss some important results. Among others, we give a
proof of the most appealing property of RQI, namely the (local) cubic
convergence. We also provide an overview on the history of RQI and
discuss some more recent contributions. Various numerical experiments
that illustrate the different properties will be given in the next
chapter where we compare RQI with our new method. In this chapter we
only look at very few numerical examples.
