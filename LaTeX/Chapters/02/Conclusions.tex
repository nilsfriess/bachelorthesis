\section{Conclusions}%
In this chapter we introduced RQI and discussed some very favourable
properties of the algorithm. For instance, we have seen that it is
practically impossible to make RQI fail to converge to any eigenpair
and that convergence is locally cubic. However, it seems to be
difficult, if not impossible, to predict which eigenpair the method
will converge to. In the next chapter, when we discuss our novel
method, we will throughout compare it to RQI. There we will see that
RQI often fails to compute the correct eigenpair even for initial
error angles below $20^\circ$.
