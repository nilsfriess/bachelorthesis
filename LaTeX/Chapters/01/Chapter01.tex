\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:intro}%
This thesis introduces a novel shift-and-invert method to compute
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric matrices. The method is
a modification of \emph{Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (RQI)}. Numerical
examples suggest that our method overcomes some of the drawbacks of
RQI at the expense of a slower convergence rate.

The thesis is structured as follows. In this chapter, we introduce a
model problem from physics and collect the necesarry definitions and
results from numerical linear algebra. We also review some of the most
basic iterative methods for eigenvalue problems.  The second chapter
is devoted to the study of the Rayleigh Quotient and Rayleigh Quotient
Iteration. Among others, we give a proof for the property that makes
RQI advantageous over other methods, viz., the local cubic
convergence.  In the third chapter we introduce our novel method that
we call \emph{Complex Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}. After motivating
the method, different numerical experiments are carried out to better
understand the behaviour of the method.
