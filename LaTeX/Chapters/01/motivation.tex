\section{Model Problem}
There is a plethora of examples which lead to eigenvalue problems in
almost all of the natural sciences, engineering and many other
disciplines. The example below leads to an eigenvalue problem with
eigenvalues that are very closely spaced. As we will see later,
traditional methods do not deal well with this problem.
